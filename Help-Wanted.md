* Developers to port the optimized assembly for the various video and audio functions (all porting must be Win32/64 and Linux32/64 compatible).  In particular, we would like to port key functions such as color space conversion.
* Developer(s) to write a more full-featured AVXEdit application with syntax highlighting, and parameter help (like AvsEdit).
* Testers skilled in AviSynth, Windows, and Linux, to help complete the test matrix for the set of ported functions.
* Autoconf and cmake expert to build Linux installable package.
